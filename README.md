# Solar-Car

I worked on the suspension and steering subteam of the UCI Solar Car Project, where I contributed to the design, analysis, and integration of critical vehicle subsystems for a solar-powered race car. My role involved applying mechanical engineering principles to ensure that the suspension and steering systems could withstand the loads and stresses experienced during dynamic driving conditions while maintaining safety, reliability, and performance. I assisted in concept development and CAD modeling of suspension geometries and steering linkages, evaluating trade-offs between weight, strength, and manufacturability. Using simulation tools and engineering calculations, I analyzed kinematics, load transfer, and component stresses, optimizing designs for both efficiency and durability. I also participated in the fabrication and assembly process, where I gained hands-on experience working with composites, machined parts, and fastener systems to bring digital models into functional hardware. Collaboration was essential, as I worked closely with other subteams—including chassis, powertrain, and aerodynamics—to ensure proper integration and alignment of subsystems. This experience gave me exposure to the end-to-end engineering workflow, from design and validation to real-world implementation, while building teamwork and problem-solving skills in a competitive motorsports-style environment.
